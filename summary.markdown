METACARPA simulation
=================

 The root of all simulations is in `/lustre/scratch114/projects/helic/checkpoints/metacarpa_sim`. Scripts were first written in `/nfs/team144/Arthur-Kallia/metacapa_sim/` but the directory turned out to be too small.

### Under the null

The simulation consists of 2 scripts, the simulator itself [simulate.sh](simulate.sh) and the runner [simrun.sh].
